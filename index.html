            <p>Welcome to my professional portfolio website. Here you can find all sorts of information about me.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="about" class="tab-content" style="display: none;">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="justified" style="line-height: 1.6">
                Hello! I am Sukrit Bera, a computer geek from Kolkata, India. As of now, I'm 19 years old,
                even though my back and knee might disagree. I am a 1st Year student in the University
                of Engineering and Management, and currently pursuing a major in Computer Science and
                Engineering, with specializations in IoT, Blockchain Technology and Cybersecurity.
                Since my early teens, I had a deep-rooted interest towards cybersecurity, particularly
                theoretical and applied cryptography for the nerdy part, and hacking for the 
                getting-hands-dirty part. No wonder I chose this specialization :)
            </p>
            <p class="justified" style="line-height: 1.6">
                Right now, besides studying, I mostly keep myself busy with my own cryptography projects,
                and some courses that I've picked up. Side projects, such as this website itself, is
                another good way of providing some productive distraction for when I'm burnt out. When I
                really need to blow off some steam, I love to get myself a nice big cup of tea, or black
                coffee, and listen to heavy metal. So that's about all that there is about me. I'm a simple
                guy, after all, who just loves to code, and do almost nothing else.
            </p>

            <h2>Educational Background</h2>
            <p class="justified" style="line-height: 1.6">
                I completed my primary and secondary education from St. Xavier's Institution, Kolkata,
                with Computer Science as my mandatory 4th subject in high school. My school was affiliated
                to CISCE, and in my ICSE Board Exams, I got an AIR of 14 with a score of 97.2%. In the
                12th Board Exams however, the ISC, I scored a less impressive 82.25%. Though I got an
                All-India Rank of 1540 in JEE Mains Paper 2 with 98.07 percentile, the national entrance
                examination for students interested in pursuing a major in Architecture, due to strong
                objection from my parents, I had to skip the opportunity of getting an admission into the
                National Institute of Technology, Patna, despite getting selected. Out of better options,
                I had to take admission in University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. My current
                major is in Computer Science and Engineering, with specializations in IoT, Blockchain
                Technology and Cybersecurity.

                research papers and articles on the topic. Though it has not been published in any journal yet, the full preprint is available for free on ResearchGate.
                As of now, I and my team have not applied for any patents.
